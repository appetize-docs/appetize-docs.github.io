        A flag indicating whether the order needs to be recalculated will be set

        An order needs to be calculated before proceeding to the submit to

        and adding payments do not alter the state of the "needs to be

        taxes, and any other relevant calculations related to the items in the
        cart. The cart totals provide an overview of the financial aspects of
        the order.

            Total amount of money accumulated for charity purposes in the order.
            This value represents the sum of all the rounded cents that are
            designated for donation to a charity. It is calculated as part of
            the order's overall financial calculations and is provided as an
            output. This field is optional and will only be present if the
            `CharityRoundingEnable` flag was set to true during the order
            creation, including zero (0) as a valid value if the
            `CharityRoundingEnable` flag was set.

            This value is always represented as a negative value to indicate the
            reduction in the total cost due to discounts. The discounts_total
            provides an overall view of the total discount amount applied to the
            order. It's important to note that the discounts_total represents
            the cumulative discounts at a given point in time. If the
            'needs_to_be_recalculated' flag is set to true, the discounts_total
            may not reflect the most recent calculations or modifications to the
            order. To ensure accurate and up-to-date discount information, it is
            recommended to recalculate the order before relying on the
            discounts_total for further processing or displaying to the user.

            the total fees incurred for the order. It's important to note that
            the fees_total represents the cumulative fees at a given point in
            time. If the 'needs_to_be_recalculated' flag is set to True, the

    The Appetize Transactions API provides access to get and list order
    information. For access, please contact Appetize. You will receive a JWT
    that defines the venues to which you have access. Use the ListOrders
    endpoint to get a list of all orders to which you have access, within a date
    and time range that you specify. Use the GetOrder endpoint to get order
    details for a specific order, using the UUID you got from the ListOrders
    endpoint.
