## Welcome to the Developer Center for {{site.product_name}}!

Let's get started on some of the important areas we'll cover through these guides.

First, we'll take you step by step to [get your store setup]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/creating-a-store) in the Connect back office. We'll guide you through getting the right access permissions, menu configurations as well as any API specific settings you may need to set. We will be sharing links to comprehensive guides along the way, but you only will need to follow the basic help guide steps to get started (we know speed of getting a test environment up is important!).

Once you have everything ready to go, we'll need to provide you with API access. For security reasons we currently don't provide self-provisioned keys (given the financial nature of our business), so you'll need to reach out to your Sales rep or Customer Success Manger to get setup. Once you have an API-Key, you're ready to [enable your API access]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/enabling-api-access).

The rest thereafter is up to personal preference! 

- Are you an engineering wizard? Dive right into the [API References]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/catalog). 
- Need some guided help to walk you through implementing a specific solution? The _API Guides_ section lines up with the API References for ease of navigation.
- Interested in learning more about the shared platform standards and implementation details? The _Common API Considerations_ section has everything from versioning guidelines to Postman Collections.
