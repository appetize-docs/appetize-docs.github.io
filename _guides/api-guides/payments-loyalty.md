Payments today are supported through our [Ordering APIs]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/placing-an-order), so please reference that documentation if you're planning to place orders with payments through our API.

We do also provide an API (PPI) to support external loyalty and payment integrations. This documentation can also be found in [Swagger](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Phantom_Squadron/PPI/1.0.0) - please engage with your {{site.product_name}} contact if you are planning to integrate as this will require support.
