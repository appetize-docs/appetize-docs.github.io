**Background:**

This page will walk you through features and details about maintaining your items in an open tab order.

**Assumptions:**

This assumes you have already reviewed the create order guide and have an open order.

**Features:**

The system provides 3 endpoints to add, edit and delete items from an open tab order.

1. Add Item(s) to an order  
2. Update an Item in an order
3. Delete an item from an order

## Add Item(s) to an order

> ðŸ“˜ Features
> 
> - You can add one to many items to an order
> - This can be a mix of Parent and Child Items (modifiers)
> - You do not have to provide all the details of each item, just the information to build the item relationships
>   - Optional fields:
>     - Price (only applies if you have price override permissions)
>     - Notes

> ðŸš§ Callouts
> 
> - When adding multiple items, if ANY add items fail, the whole request will fail and no items will be added
> - You will need to correct the issue and then re-submit everything in the request
