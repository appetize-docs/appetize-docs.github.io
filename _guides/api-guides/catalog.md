> Catalog is Changing

> Coming in Q1 of 2023 will be our first full release of the Catalog API, and there will be some changes. We're working on standardizing and improving the BETA offering, and will be adjusting some endpoints based on your feedback.
> 
> Please keep that in mind if you plan to integrate with these - we recommend you reach out to discuss which endpoints you are interested in leveraging so we can help minimize the change impacts.
