If you receive the error "bad request: item maximum_quantity cannot be greater than item set maximum_quantity" this is due to the item set has a "maximum quantity" set on the details page to a number that is lower that the number set on the item that is linked in the set. This isn't the property on the item itself, but the value that is set when looking at the item set list of items in Connect.
