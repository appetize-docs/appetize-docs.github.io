title: "Authentication of API Key"
permalink: /docs/orderingauthpost-1
excerpt: "Authenticates the client into Connect.\n\n* **Payload**: * **Success**: Returns a *token*. This token is needed to make all subsequent calls to the service.\n* **Failure**: Any other response\n* **Note:** This endpoint is actually making reference to the POST /auth from the Auth service endpoint; but being so relevant to OAPI, that it has been included here.  You will note here that /auth is an internal server redirection to the proper /ordering endpoint in the Auth service."
